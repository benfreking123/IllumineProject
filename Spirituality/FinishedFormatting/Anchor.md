An Anchor is a type of [[Talisman]], a physical representation of a more complex idea. To hone the definition, an anchor is a physical object that an individual has chosen to associate with a mental construct, most likely; a thought, idea, imagination, daydream, memory, or emotion. This Anchor is then used to call that mental state to the individuals mind.

An Anchor anchors a mental state to our material world.

## Use:
Anchor can be utilized to quickly alter one's mental state or focus in a time of need. When an individual is experiencing an emotional or mental state that is too overpowering to get away from, an anchor can be used to help the individual to a more desirable state. For example, an individual may grab a teddy bear when they need comfort (An Anchor of Comfort) or when an individual fidgets with a gifted ring from their mother to lower their stress before a big event or moment (An Anchor of Solace).

To utilize an Anchor you simply call upon it by thinking about the object and what it represents.
