Name Change: Observing
Being in the present moment
When the [[Observer]] is responding to feedback(with bkaclinks?) and not letting the body react

A moment of where the observer makes decisions and not the body. 
This is named wrong, needs a new name for being in the present moment.
Enlightenment is permanently being in the present moment.
