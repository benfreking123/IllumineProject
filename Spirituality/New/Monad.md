## Notes:

**Theology - Gnosticism**:

- In certain Gnostic systems, the monad is a divine, singular source from which everything emanates. It's a principle of God, or the highest God itself, from which lesser divine entities or Aeons emanate.

**Philosophy - Pre-Socratic & Pythagorean**:

- The term "monad" has its roots in ancient Greek philosophy. The word itself comes from the Greek word "μονάς" (monas), which means "single" or "unit".
- For the Pythagoreans, the monad was the first thing in existence. It represented unity or the number one. From the monad, all other numbers were derived, making it a primal and divine source.
