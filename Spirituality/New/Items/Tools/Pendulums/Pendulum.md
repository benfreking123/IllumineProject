A simple weighted stone or mass on the end of a string or chain.

## Use:
---
###### Attunement:
To attune your Pendulum extend your arm in front of yourself while dangling it by it's chain or string. 
Start by asking simple questions with definitive yes or no answers. Note which direction the pedant moves in response to the definitive yes or no question. This will be the method of [[Divination]] using the pendant.

###### Actions:
Extend your pendant as described in the Attunement section then ask a direct question mentally or verbally that can be answered with a yes or no answer.


## Grounds:
--- 
A simple spiritual [[tool]] to allow for the subconscious to express itself through muscle micro-movements determining the swing of the pendant.


## Notes:
- - - 
Careful trusting pendant answers as ultimate truth for they are a low level common item

To increase the usefulness and power of a pendant perform a more advance attunement by incorrperating a 'Maybe' or 'Unsure' section to your answers.
