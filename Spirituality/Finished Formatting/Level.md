## Notes:

Using Milestone:
Like:
1 - Enlightenment- Enlightment is a moment that you see and then are inspired to follow through magick - Its the observer making decisions not the body, your first enlightment is the first time the observer imagines or backlinks a thought to the body and the body choose that reaction instead of a responds - Not Reacting, Responding
5 - [[The Spark]] - doing Magick above the spark (level 6+) when you dont have it will cause it to be chaotic, like [[Tyler Durden]] & Garfield
