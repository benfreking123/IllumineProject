An ultimate identity of an [[Aspect|Aspect]] of [[God]]
- - -
## Creation:
Names are not created but learned, through understanding an [[Aspect|Aspect]] of [[God]].
- - -
## Use:
Used to call an [[Aspect]] of [[God]] into the user's mind/imagination
- - -
## Notes:
I used in all aspects of magick, is more then just letters, a name is a full understanding of an entity

Dementia is the process of forgetting names

In christianity: they talk about the idea of finding your ultimate indenity in/through god.
