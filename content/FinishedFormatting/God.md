Everything

The reason for the name is that my everything includes the lucid and astral

The totality of all [[Astral Realm|Astral Realms]]

Need a name for the smaller ‘god’ of just the [[Lucid Realm|Lucid Realm]] & [[Material Realm]]

## Notes:
To know the [[Name]] of god is to know all of existence, is to know the [[Name]] of everything. If you truly know the [[Name]] of a [[Aspect]] of [[God]] then you can call the purest form of that [[Aspect]], thus if you know the [[Name]] of everything then you are god.

God is the Traveler and the Ghost is the Human
Ghost sometimes can be cutoff from God just like humans can

It interesting to see version of 'our truth' coming out in other stories around the world

Combined all of humans to make the aspect or deity of god called Humanity
